## Background

I've been exploring ways to represent Option or Result types in TypeScript that
would be intuitive to use and have idiomatic functionality, similar to how
promises work. This is the incarnation of these explorations. Think of lodash,
but as utilities for functional programming.

Fair warning, even though these concepts can be used without much knowledge
about functional programming. I wholeheartedly recommend to understand the
basics of functional programming before using these utilities.
